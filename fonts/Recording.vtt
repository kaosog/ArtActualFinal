I want to take a moment to reflect on the profound impact Kobe Bryant has had on my life.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Growing up, I admire his relentless work ethic, unbreakable determination, and the way

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
he approached every challenge with the same intensity no matter the odds.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Throughout sports, whenever I felt exhausted and my body ached, my mind told me to stop

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
I thought of Kobe and his mob mentality.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
It taught me that pushing one step further, even when you feel you've reached your limit,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
is what separates the good from the great.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
It's that extra effort that unwillingness to settle that shapes true champions.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
As I look forward, I carry that mindset with me.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Not just in my career, but in every aspect of my life.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
I know that no matter where I end up, his example will continue to guide me,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
pushing me to succeed, to give my all, and to always believe in myself.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
As I move forward, building a strong future for myself and my family,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I will draw on the lessons he left behind, not just as a player,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
but as a father, a mentor, and a person who inspired millions.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Thank you, Kobe, for the legacy you've left us, for teaching us to dream bigger,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
work harder, and love deeper.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
We carry your spirit with us, and for that I am forever grateful.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Thank you, Kobe.
