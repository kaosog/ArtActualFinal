<!-- <p id = "coverparagpraph"> Dedicated to Kobe Bryant—a legend whose impact reached far beyond the game of basketball. He inspired millions with his courage, determination, and relentless pursuit of greatness. Though he lived a life unlike most of us, his "Mamba Mentality" reminds us that with hard work and passion, we all have the power to rise above challenges. As a father and mentor, Kobe led with love, wisdom, and strength. Even if we aren’t parents, we can still carry his lessons into our own lives—striving to be better, to lift others, and to leave a legacy worth remembering.</p>

  <p id="coverparagpraph">
    Kobe Bryant's relentless work ethic, unbreakable determination, and "Mamba Mentality" have profoundly shaped my life. 
    In moments of doubt and exhaustion, when my body ached and my mind said to quit, I thought of Kobe — his refusal to settle, his drive to push further, even at the edge. 
    That mindset, to give more when you feel spent, defines true champions. 
    As I move forward, I carry his lessons not just as a player, but as a father, mentor, and relentless competitor. 
    Thank you, Kobe, for inspiring us to dream bigger, work harder, and believe deeper.
