  <p id = "careerP1">Beyond individual accolades, Bryant’s impact shone in critical moments. He secured two Finals MVP awards (2009, 2010), leading the Lakers past Orlando and Boston with averages of 32.4 and 28.6 points, respectively. A 15-time All-NBA selection and 12-time All-Defensive honoree, he balanced scoring with tenacious defense, often guarding the opponent’s best player. His 33,643 career points rank fourth all-time, a testament to his consistency across 1,346 games, even through injuries like a torn Achilles in 2013.</p>
